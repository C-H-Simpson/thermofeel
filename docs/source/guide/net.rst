Normal Effective Temperature (NET)
======================================

Normal effective temperature (NET) is also known as normal effective temperature. It links effective temperature which indicates \
the effects on comfort through air temperature and relative humidity \
and an organismâ€™s thermoregulatory capacity.

How To Use
-----------------
You need 2m temperature  and 2m dew point temperature in Kelvin and 10 m wind speed in m/s.

The wind speed in this method is converted to 2 m as an approximation of 1.2 m wind speed.

.. code-block:: python

    calculate_net_effective_temperature(2m_temperature, wind_speed, 2m_dew_point_temperature)

Interpret the Output
------------------------
Here is a suggested way for you to interpret Net Effective Temperature outputs. However, it is by no means the only way to go about defining thermal stress.
